\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data set of sub-daily weather records for either an AWS or a
Synoptic source.}

values.}

\item{crop}{If \code{TRUE} (default), discard the rainfall for an initial

\description{
This is primarily a helper function called by other functions when
calculating fire-related variables. It aggregates sub-daily rainfall data to
daily values, taking into account the different conventions used for AWS and
Syoptic data sources. Each value for each day is the total rainfall recorded
from 09:01 that day to 09:00 the following day. If there are any missing days
in the time series, the function will stop with an error.
